# cpu-scheduler-visualizer
## Overview
CPU Scheduler Visualizer is an interactive web-based tool designed to simulate and visualize different CPU scheduling algorithms. This project helps users understand how processes are scheduled in an operating system, providing clear insights into waiting time, turnaround time, and overall system performance.

## Features
- Interactive visualization of scheduling algorithms
- Supports multiple scheduling algorithms:
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive & Preemptive)
- Performance metrics calculations:
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Throughput
- Clean UI for an easy-to-understand representation of process execution
